down there is what i was going to do. hwat i did is a control layout for moving a rectangle and making you loose if you touch the edges



would be cool to randomly spawn foor to catch and to add more divs for the controls(or use the keys)

















There will be a white square in the middle

there will be red squares appearing at a random place on the canvas, and moving towards the white square

the white square shoots small square that kill a red square if they touch them 




we need to:

//calculate square sizes based on window.height and window.width

//create the white square in the center of the screen

create the red squares in a random place of the edge and move them to the white square

make the bullets appear 
	make a way to control the bullet direction

make the collision detection for the red and white squares


TANGENTS

4 invisible buttons that span a quarter of the screen each

	for now move the white square to that direction
